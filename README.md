# NCFCA-At-Large-Calculator
This program automatically calculates NCFCA-At-Large points, and writes the results to a google sheet. The program is currently set to update the sheet once a week. The google sheet is avalible for anyone in NCFCA, but for privacy reasons I am not going to put the link out publically. Ask around if anyone has my contact info, and contact me to get the link to the sheet. I am part of Region 6, if that helps you find me.
